# DeepC64Generation

Exploratory repo for generating C64 chiptunes, one sample at a time!

The basic format right now is a bunch of ipython workbooks while we try out various BS.  
As there are cross dependencies among workbooks (because coding fast and dirty), these should be executed in numbered order.

As we get out of EDA phase and into more 'actual' work, we'll move over to python scripts and a real data pipeline and other
fun bits.
